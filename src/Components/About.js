            <p>I am a full time student at the State University of New York at New Paltz
                New York. My goal is to pursue a career in Software Development because
                I enjoy learning new materials and creating new softwares. I enjoy
                taking on difficult challenges and solving them with prior knowledge
                or with outside resources.
